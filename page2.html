  <h1>Kennebunkport</h1>

  <div>
    <p class="kbport">Back in July 2016, my boyfriend and I took a trip to Maine and
    started the trip in Kennebunkport. Kennebunkport is a quick hour
    and a half drive from Boston Logan International Airport. Here are
    some highlights from the trip.</p>

  <p class="kbportheaders">Day 1:</p>

  <div>
    <p class="kbport2">We arrived in Kennebunkport and checked into the Yachtsman Lodge
    which was right on the water at the Marina. It was a quaint hotel
    and walking distance to downtown. Since the hotel is on the Marina,
    we had lots of duck visitors! We then walked around downtown, Kennebunkport is
    the definition of a quintessential New England town. We went into the various
    shops and had dinner at David's KPT - highly recommend!

  <p class="kbport2">The second day we walked around downtown, Kennebunkport is
    the definition of a quintessential New England town. We went into the various
    shops and had dinner at David's KPT - highly recommend!</p>
